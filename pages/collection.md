This digital collection was created in collaboration with Blackwell Regional Branch of the Free Library. Attendees were asked to bring and share their photographs, documents, and stories of the West Philadelphia. As part of a Community Data Curation Pilot, attendees were offer access to digitization technology and workflows, and were able to ask a library professional questions about preservation and access. The goal of the event was both to alleviate cost-barriers to preservation though resource sharing, and to document the lively and robust history of 52nd street through community dialogue and engagement. Do you have items/documents you'd like help preserving? Would you like to host a similar event at your institution? Please reach out to us at garconj@upenn.edu.

notes: 'This photograph was taken prior to the forced removal of South African racial
  groups. At this time, early 1950s, Newclare was one of the few racially integrated
  areas. Has been classified as a racially mixed neighborhood, or a "coloured area".
  Shortly after this photograph was taken the Apartheid regime enforced racial segregation
  and forcibly moved people into racially designated townships. '
